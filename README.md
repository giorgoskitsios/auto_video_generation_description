# Auto Video Generation Description

I made this repo so I can describe what I built. Unfortunately the actual code repo is not publicly available but you can always request access.
This Project is built with python and what it does is, given a text and a folder with clips, it can create a voiceover, add it to the randomly concatenated clips and add subtitles to the final output video. It can be used for social media automated content creation. Since it was built before the advent of advanced generative AI, it can be drastically improved.
